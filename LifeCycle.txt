Software Design Life Cycle

Definition
SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system to an application in software development. Though is can be appplied to development in general.

Stages
1) Identify the problem: Find out what the problem is. This would mean to get all input from people you are working with. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of a system.
2) Plan: Identify what you want and determine the cost and resources that are needed for implementing the analyzed requirements. In other words, the team should figure out if the plan can be accomplished and the successabiliy rate.
3) Design: Figure out how you want to get what you want. It is important to gather input from the team in order to work at achieving a better and more effiecient application. 
4) Build: This is where you begin to follow through with your plan and design to create and actual product. It's important to make sure that everyone is onboard with the design and that there are proper guidlines being applied to create the project successfully.
5)Test: In this stage, look for defects and deficiencies that can possibly costs lots of money. Fix the product until original specifications are met.
6)Software Deployment: At this stage, you publicly announce your product that should be in full working order. You will want to be sure to look for any bugs that are in the final product before releasing. 

This process then get's repeated depending on the model.
